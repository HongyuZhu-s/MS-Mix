Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose **MS-Mix**, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings.

## 🛠 Installation
We use the **M-SENA framework** ("https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA") to evaluate MSA models. It is a unified framework for multimodal sentiment analysis. Please install it before proceeding.

*Run `pip install MMSA` in your python virtual environment.*
